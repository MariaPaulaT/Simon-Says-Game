# Simon-Says-Game

The game is called "Simon Says" and it's a memory game where you need to follow a pattern of button presses. You'll start by pressing any key on the keyboard, which will trigger the game to start.

The game has four buttons of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow), and each time you start a new level, the game will generate a sequence of button presses that you need to repeat. The sequence will be displayed to you through animations and sounds.

To play, you'll need to click on the buttons in the same order as the sequence that was displayed to you. Each time you press a button, it will light up and make a sound. If you correctly follow the entire sequence, the game will move on to the next level, and the sequence will be longer.

If you make a mistake, the game will play a "wrong" sound and display a "Game Over" message. You can restart the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.

The goal of the game is to see how far you can get by correctly repeating the button sequences. Good luck!
